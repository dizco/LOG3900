/**
 setTimeout()

 Shorthand method for create a delayed block to be execute on started Thread.

 This method returns ``Timer`` instance, so that user may execute the block
 within immediately or keep the reference for further cancelation by calling
 ``Timer.invalidate()``

 Example:
 let timer = setTimeout(0.3) {
 // do something
 }
 timer.invalidate()      // cancel it.
 */
func setTimeout(_ delay: TimeInterval, block: @escaping () -> Void) -> Timer {
    return Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: delay, target: BlockOperation(block: block), selector: #selector(Operation.main), userInfo: nil, repeats: false)
}

/**
 setInternval()

 Similar to setTimeout() this method will return ``Timer`` instance however, this
 method will execute repeatedly.

 Warning using this method with caution, it is recommended that the block to utilise
 this method should call [unowned self] or [weak self] to announce OS that it should not
 hold strong reference to this block.

 In addition, ``Timer`` returned should kept as member variable, and call invalidated()
 when the block no longer required. such as deinit, or viewDidDisappear()

    return Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: interval, target: BlockOperation(block: block), selector: #selector(Operation.main), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)
